**Making Suffrage Work - Does the Political Impact of Women's Vote Depend on its Environment?**

**Abstract:** Institutions and their environment both shape political outcomes. Identifying their independent effect empirically is however difficult, because institutions are likely to self-select into context, and the context itself could be affected by institutions. I exploit quasi-random local franchise extensions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the political impact of female suffrage in two opposing environments: Municipalities with a male majority in favour of women's vote and municipalities with a male majority against it. In both contexts, I find that left and liberal parties in local elections lose and populists gain as female suffrage is introduced. In a simple ecological analysis, I find only weak evidence that this shift can be explained through how women vote. Instead, my results cautiously suggest a political backlash reaction of men. This paper therefore contributes to our understanding of how well democratic institutions function within environments that welcome versus reject them.

**Enforcing Women's Rights - Can Female Suffrage Change Gender Views?**

**Abstract:** I exploit quasi-random introductions of female suffrage in Swiss cantons to investigate whether they affect men's support for women's right to vote at the national level. Being exposed to a local franchise extension between two referenda on national female suffrage in 1959 and 1971 had a significant positive impact on the male vote share in favour of the referendum. At a closer look, this effect only occurred for municipalities where a majority of men had (initially) opposed women's vote, while there is no evidence for an effect for municipalities that had always supported it. I show that this is not simply a "ceiling effect" and I use local Swiss census data in order to test whether exposure further had an impact on local gender roles proxied by female labour market participation, marriage rates and number of children. I find no support for this hypothesis, but instead I suggest that local female suffrage informed men about women's political preferences, which turned out to be more conservative than expected.

**A Quality-based Explanation for the Incumbency Curse** *with Hugo Reichhardt and Greg Sheen*

**Abstract:** In their APSR article, Klasnja and Titiunik (2017) report a strong electoral disadvantage incumbent parties face in weak party environments like Brazil. As explanation, they propose a theory where voters punish parties who failed to discipline their lame duck incumbents. In this research note, we argue that KT misinterpret their finding and instead identify what Eggers (2017) introduced as quality-based incumbency effect. We combine empirical evidence from a replicated sample of KT's data with a model on candidate selection by Carrillo and Mariotti (2001) to support our case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to provide empirical evidence for the theoretical framework brought forward by Eggers (2017).
