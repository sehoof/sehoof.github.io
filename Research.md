### Democracy, even if you dislike it - Does the political impact of female suffrage depend on its environment?

Institutions and their environment both shape political outcomes. Identifying their independent effect empirically is however difficult, because institutions are likely to self-select into context, and the context itself could be affected by institutions. I exploit quasi-random local franchise extensions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the political impact of female suffrage in two opposing environments: Municipalities with a male majority in favour of women's vote and municipalities with a male majority against it. In both contexts, I find that left and liberal parties in local elections lose and populists gain as female suffrage is introduced. In a simple ecological analysis, I find only weak evidence that this shift can be explained through how women vote. Instead, my results cautiously suggest a political backlash reaction of men. This paper therefore contributes to our understanding of how well democratic institutions function within environments that welcome versus reject them.


### A Quality-based Explanation for the Incumbency Curse 
<br><sup>with Hugo Reichhardt and Greg Sheen</sup>

In their APSR article, Klasnja and Titiunik (2017) report a strong electoral disadvantage incumbent parties face in weak party environments like Brazil. As explanation, they propose a theory where voters punish parties who failed to discipline their lame duck incumbents. In this research note, we argue that KT misinterpret their finding and instead identify what Eggers (2017) introduced as quality-based incumbency effect. We combine empirical evidence from a replicated sample of KT's data with a model on candidate selection by Carrillo and Mariotti (2001) to support our case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to provide empirical
evidence for the theoretical framework brought forward by Eggers (2017).
