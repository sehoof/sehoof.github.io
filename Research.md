**Making Suffrage Work - Does the Political Impact of Women's Vote Depend on its Environment?**

Institutions and their environment both shape political outcomes. Identifying their independent effect empirically is however difficult, because institutions are likely to self-select into context, and the context itself could be affected by institutions. I exploit quasi-random local franchise extensions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the political impact of female suffrage in two opposing environments: Municipalities with a male majority in favour of women's vote and municipalities with a male majority against it. In both contexts, I find that left and liberal parties in local elections lose and populists gain as female suffrage is introduced. In a simple ecological analysis, I find only weak evidence that this shift can be explained through how women vote. Instead, my results cautiously suggest a political backlash reaction of men. This paper therefore contributes to our understanding of how well democratic institutions function within environments that welcome versus reject them.
