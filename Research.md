** Democracy, even if you dislike it - Does the political impact of female suffrage depend on its environment?

Institutions and their environment both shape political outcomes. Identi-
fying their independent effect empirically is however dicult, because in-
stitutions are likely to self-select into context, and the context itself could
be affected by institutions. I exploit quasi-random local franchise exten-
sions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the
political impact of female suffrage in two opposing environments: Munici-
palities with a male majority in favour of women's vote and municipalities
with a male majority against it. In both contexts, I find that left and lib-
eral parties in local elections lose and populists gain as female surage is
introduced. In a simple ecological analysis, I find only weak evidence that
this shift can be explained through how women vote. Instead, my results
cautiously suggest a political backlash reaction of men. This paper there-
fore contributes to our understanding of how well democratic institutions
function within environments that welcome versus reject them.
