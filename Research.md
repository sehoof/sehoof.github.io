**Democracy, even if you dislike it - Does the political impact of female suffrage depend on its environment?

Institutions and their environment both shape political outcomes. Identifying their independent effect empirically is however difficult, because institutions are likely to self-select into context, and the context itself could be affected by institutions. I exploit quasi-random local franchise extensions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the political impact of female suffrage in two opposing environments: Municipalities with a male majority in favour of women's vote and municipalities with a male majority against it. In both contexts, I find that left and liberal parties in local elections lose and populists gain as female suffrage is introduced. In a simple ecological analysis, I find only weak evidence that this shift can be explained through how women vote. Instead, my results cautiously suggest a political backlash reaction of men. This paper therefore contributes to our understanding of how well democratic institutions function within environments that welcome versus reject them.
