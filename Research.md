**Making Suffrage Work - The impact of female suffrage in different environments**

**Abstract:** <p align=”justify”> I exploit quasi-random local franchise extensions to Swiss women in the late 20th century to empirically identify the political impact of female suffrage in different contexts: In municipalities with a male majority in favor of women's vote and in municipalities with a male majority against it. I further study municipalities with a parliament versus direct-democratic assemblies. My findings suggest that female suffrage caused a right-wing effect in municipal party vote shares and expenditure. Municipalities, which favoured female suffrage, show a stronger shift away from the left, but towards conservative and independent instead of right-wing populist parties. They also experienced a lower drop in liberal party vote shares and electoral turnout. Municipalities in which a parliament instead of an assembly decides over the budget, show an increase instead of a drop in expenditure. I complement my findings with a national election survey from 1972 to shed light on the possible mechanisms behind the identified effects.</p>

**What Drives Support For Enfranchisment? - The Case of Swiss Female Suffrage**

**Abstract:** Democratisation literature mostly focuses on the elite's decision to extend the franchise. But in many cases, current voters have to decide whether to grant the vote to a broader population. Little evidence exists on what factors drive the support among those who are already enfranchised. In this paper, I exploit the change in municipal Yes-vote shares among male voters for two Swiss national referenda on female suffrage between 1959 and 1971. I show that municipalities, which quasi-randomly introduced local female suffrage in between the two referenda increased their support much more. This increase is driven by municipalities, in which a majority of men was initially opposed to national suffrage. Conditioning on similar initial support, I further show that this difference cannot be explained by a "ceiling effect". My findings can also not corroborate that the rise in support is driven by post-suffrage change in municipal party vote shares, expenditure, or cultural proxies, such as female labour market participation.

**Candidate Quality in the Partisan Incumbency Disadvantage - A Revised Empirical Strategy** *with Greg Chih-Hsin Sheen*

**Abstract:** We show that canonical regression discontinuity designs (RD) to estimate a partisan incumbency disadvantage can be downward biased due to unbalanced candidate quality in the next election after a close race. Cause is the use of term limits, which force narrowly winning parties to nominate new candidates, while narrow losers are free to choose the strongest possible contender such as the previous runner-up. We propose a revised empirical strategy to circumvent this risk. With data from Brazilian mayoral elections in 1996-2012, we apply both the canonical and the revised strategy to identify the electoral disadvantage incumbent parties face. We find that using the new approach cuts the effect by three quarters (from -13.2% to -3.1%). Candidate quality differences might be stronger in weak party systems such as Brazil, because post-term limit candidates tend to be of even lower quality than in an environment where strong parties have more control over their nomination process.
