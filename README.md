I am a PhD candidate at the Government Department (Political Science & Political Economy, PSPE) at LSE. 

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the Perelman Center for Political Science & Economics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia until December 2019. From January until April, I will be a visiting research at Uppsala University in Sweden. In July 2019, I participated at the EITM Summer Institute at Emory University. I am also a LSE STICERD PhD grant holder since June 2019.

Using quantitative methods, my research mainly analyses the performance of democratic institutions with a focus on women. 

In 2018, my PhD colleagues and I founded "VAM - Very Applied Methods" as a cooperation between the LSE European Institute, the Government and Methodology Department. We were awarded a grant in order to organise regular cross-departmental PhD workshops on applying quantitative methods and programming in research.

My passions besides research are reading and sports (especially running & tennis), and I am an active member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club.
