I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University's Democracy \& Polarization Lab](https://stanforddpl.org/). I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from the London School of Economics (LSE). My research analyses the performance of democratic institutions with a focus on women.

I use empirical quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference, but I am also familiar with game theory and very interested in co-authoring with formal theorists. For my dissertation on the introduction of local female suffrage in Switzerland, I collected and coded an unique historical dataset at the Swiss municipality level between 1940-1990. To complete this, I received support from the [Baroness Birk Award](http://www.lse.ac.uk/supporting-lse/your-gifts-in-action/2016-2017/20-years-of-the-baroness-birk-award) and the [STICERD Ph.D. Grant](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/funding/grants/PhD.asp).

From March until June 2020, I visited Uppsala University. From September 2019 until March 2020, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. I attended the [EITM Summer Institute](http://eitm.emory.edu/) at Emory University in 2019 and the [Zurich Summer School for Women in Political Methodology](http://zurichsummerschool.com/) in 2017. 

I am a co-founder of LSE's [*"VAM - Very Applied Methods"*](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5881), a cooperation between the European Institute, the Government and the Methodology Department at LSE. We organise and teach regular cross-departmental PhD workshops on applying quantitative methods and programming in research.

My addictions besides research are reading and sports. I am also a devoted member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club, which replaced my active participation in the Young Liberals party (*"Jungfreisinn"*) while living in Switzerland.
