I am a PhD candidate at the Government Department (Political Science & Political Economy, PSPE) at LSE. 

I am currently a visiting researcher at the Perelman Center for Political Science & Economics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia until December 2019. From January until April, I will be a visiting research at Uppsala University in Sweden. I participated at the EITM Summer Institute at Emory University in 2019.

Using quantitative methods, my research mainly analyses the performance of democratic institutions with a focus on women. 

With my colleagues 

My passions besides research are reading and sports (especially running & tennis), and I am an active member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club.
