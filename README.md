I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Government Department (Political Science & Political Economy, PSPE) at LSE. My research analyses the performance of democratic institutions with a focus on women. 

I use empirical quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference, but I am also familiar with game theory and very interested in co-authoring with formal theorists. For my dissertation on the introduction of local female suffrage in Switzerland, I collected and coded an unique historical dataset at the Swiss municipality level between 1950-1990. To complete this, I was supported by a [STICERD Ph.D. grant](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/funding/grants/PhD.asp).

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia until December 2019. From January until April 2020, I will be a visiting researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden. I attended the EITM Summer Institute at Emory University in 2019 and the Zurich Summer School for Women in Political Methodology in 2017. 

I am a co-founder of LSE's *"VAM - Very Applied Methods"*, a cooperation between the European Institute, the Government and the Methodology Department at LSE. We organise and teach regular cross-departmental PhD workshops on applying quantitative methods and programming in research.

My addictions besides research are reading and sports. I am also a devoted member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club, which replaced my active participation in the Young Liberals party (*"Jungfreisinn"*) while living in Switzerland.
