I am a PhD candidate at the Government Department (Political Science & Political Economy, PSPE) at LSE. Using quantitative methods, my research analyses the performance of democratic institutions with a focus on women.  

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia until December 2019. From January until April, I will be a visiting researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden. I participated at the EITM Summer Institute at Emory University in 2019 and at the Zurich Summer School for Women in Political Methodology in 2017. 

In 2018, my colleagues and I founded "VAM - Very Applied Methods" as a cooperation between the LSE European Institute, the Government and Methodology Department. We organise and teach regular cross-departmental PhD workshops on applying quantitative methods and programming in research.

My passions besides research are reading (mainly classics & history) and sports (especially running, tennis & skiing). I am also a devoted member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club, which replaced my active participation in the Young Liberals party ("Jungfreisinn") while living in Switzerland.
