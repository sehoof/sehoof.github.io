I am a PhD candidate at the Government Department (Political Science & Political Economy, PSPE) at LSE. 

I am currently a visiting researcher at the Perelman Center for Political Science & Economics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia until December 2019. From January until April, I will be a visiting research at Uppsala University in Sweden. I participated at the EITM Summer Institute at Emory University in 2019.

Using game theory and quantitative methods as tools, my research mainly focuses on media and politics in democracies and autocracies. Specifically, it is about the information problem faced by dictators and voters. I also conduct other projects investigating underlying causes of political decisions in various contexts.

I devote myself to sharing new insights from political science research to the public. With a group of young Taiwanese political scientists, I founded Who Governs Taiwan? , which is now one of the most visited popular science websites in Taiwan. Recently, we published a book on electoral democracy (in Mandarin). 

My passions beside research are reading and sports (especially long runs), and I am a committee member of the Toastmasters 104 London Debaters club.
