I am a Visiting Researcher at the Department of Political Science at the University of Zurich. From 2022-2025, I was an Assistant Professor in Political Science at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.

Within comparative politics, my research focuses on voting behavior and the effects and causes of women's political inclusion. I study these topics in Western Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the US. My research employs causal inference methods using both experimental and observational data.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the London School of Economics (LSE). Before joining Tec de Monterrey, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Democracy & Polarization Lab (DPL) at Stanford University.
