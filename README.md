I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. 

Within comparative politics, my research focuses on voting behavior and the effects and causes of women's political inclusion. I study these topics in Western Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the US. My research employs causal inference methods, including both experimental and observational data.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the London School of Economics (LSE). Before joining Tec de Monterrey, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University's Democracy & Polarization Lab](https://stanforddpl.org/).
